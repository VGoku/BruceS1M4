<!-- Intro to HTML & CSS I

  Module Project Overview

    You will build a website to display the bio of your favorite programmer, artist, etc.

    In order to do this, you will create an `index.html` file and scaffold the document
    with the elements shared by all HTML documents:

    - doctype declaration
    - html element
    - head, containing a title and an optional style tag
    - body, containing the markup that renders to the screen

  Requirements

    Review this article: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp

    Create an `index.html` file for your site, or use this same file.

    For your site, you will make use of at least the following semantic elements:

    - header (to contain the main heading of the site, and the nav)
    - nav (to contain some links to navigate to the different sections of this document)
    - section (each holding at least a heading and a paragraph)
    - aside (containing an img and a caption)
    - footer (containing a contact form)
    - form (containing at least two inputs with their labels)

    See an example of a finished site: https://bloominstituteoftechnology.github.io/img/anita-borg-bio-website.png

    The example above is quite simple, but you can make your site as fancy as you'd like. -->

        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>Lee's father Lee Hoi-chuen was a famous Cantonese opera star. 
          As a result, the junior Lee was introduced to the world of cinema at a very young age and appeared in several films as a child. 
          Lee had his first role as a baby who was carried onto the stage in the film Golden Gate Girl. 
          He took his Chinese stage name as lit. Lee the Little Dragon, 
          for the fact that he was born in both the hour and the year of the Dragon by the Chinese zodiac.
          As a nine-year-old, he co-starred with his father in The Kid in 1950, 
          which was based on a comic book character and was his first leading role. 
          By the time he was 18, he had appeared in 20 films. 
          After attending Tak Sun School  several blocks from his home at 218 Nathan Road, Kowloon, 
          Lee entered the primary school division of the Catholic La Salle College at age 12.</p>
